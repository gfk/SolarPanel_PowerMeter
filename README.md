Solar Panel Power Meter using an Arduino nano (ATMega328) with an OLED display.

I'm using the U8glib library so pretty much any LCD/OLED display could be used.

It's designed to be powered from the battery charged by the solar panel. With this in mind, an effort has been made to reduce the power consumption.
